# Credit Risk Prediction - Loan Default Probability

This project predicts credit risk (loan default probability) using machine learning models such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. It includes a Streamlit web app for easy user interaction and visualization of predictions, along with a Jupyter Notebook for model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## üìå Key Features:
- **Loan approval risk prediction**: Predict the probability of loan default using multiple machine learning models.
- **Model comparison & hyperparameter tuning**: Compare the performance of different models and fine-tune their hyperparameters to optimize prediction accuracy.
- **Interactive visualizations**: Visualize the results with interactive charts (e.g., pie charts, bar plots, scatter plots, heatmaps) to gain insights into the dataset and model performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning models and tools
  - `XGBoost`: Gradient boosting framework for prediction
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data visualization
  - `Streamlit`: Web app for interacting with the model
  - `joblib`: Saving and loading trained models
- **Deployment**:
  - Streamlit for web app deployment
