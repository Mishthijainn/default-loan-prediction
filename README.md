# Credit Risk Prediction - Loan Default Probability
## Overview
This project predicts credit risk by evaluating the probability of loan default using machine learning models such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. It features an interactive Streamlit web app to allow easy user interaction, along with visualizations for deeper insights into the loan approval process. The project also includes a Jupyter Notebook for model training, evaluation, and comparison.

## Key Features
Loan Approval Risk Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of loan defaults based on historical data.
Model Comparison: Compares the performance of different models (Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes the model using techniques like GridSearchCV.
Interactive Visualizations: Visual representations of data insights using pie charts, bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

## Technologies Used
Machine Learning: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, AdaBoost, RandomForest
Web Framework: Streamlit (for the web app)
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Modeling & Evaluation: Jupyter Notebook for training and performance analysis
